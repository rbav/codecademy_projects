## The following program allows manipulation of lists using various python commands

## below is the list called "inventory"
inventory = ["twin bed", "twin bed", "headboard", "queen bed", "king bed", "dresser", "dresser", "table", "table", "nightstand", "nightstand", "king bed", "king bed", "twin bed", "twin bed", "sheets", "sheets", "pillow", "pillow"]

#creates a variable and records the number of entries from the list "inventory"
inventory_len = len(inventory)

#creates a variable "first" stores the first entry from the list above
first = inventory[0]

#creates a variable "last" stores the last entry from the list above using negative counting method
last = inventory[-1]

#creates a variable list which stores the first three entries
first_3 = inventory[0:3]

#creates a variable "twin_beds" and counts how many times the term "twin bed" appears in the above list
twin_beds = inventory.count("twin bed")

# creates a variable called "removed_item" and records the 5th entry in the list above then removes it from the list using the .pop command
removed_item = inventory[4]
inventory.pop(4)

#creates a variable called "inventory_2_6 and records the entries between 3 and 6"
inventory_2_6 = inventory[2:6]

#adds the "19th..." entry to the 10ths position
inventory.insert(10, "19th Century Bed Frame")

#sorts the list "inventory" alphabetically
inventory.sort()
print(inventory)
